\sectionListStart
    \sectionListItem
        Led the initiative to improve document collaboration experience for clients by implementing RESTful web-services through a novel concept of API-first design (Swagger).
    \sectionListItem
        Proposed and implemented a new architecture for speeding up certain slower API operations using messaging queues, leading to almost 3x faster response times.
    
    \sectionListItem
        Implemented an important component for a new document management system that improves over existing based on an event-driven, service oriented architecture, expected to cut costs by \$1.7M annually.
    
    \sectionListItem
        Built a gateway component in front of a legacy system to facilitate routing of requests to SOAP or REST web services as well as message conversions between XML, JSON and Google Protocol Buffers.
    
    \sectionListItem    
        Effectively collaborated with teams based in Mumbai, Montreal and New York to work on multiple proof of concepts, some of which were deployed to production. 
        
    % \sectionListItem
    %     Integrated thousands of lines of code with Morgan Stanley's  stack, improved code coverage for a Java module from 50\% to 70\%.
     
    % \sectionListItem  
    %     Automated the process of BPM plant's recovery from failed requests through periodic retries, ensured its stability by throttling requests sent per second.     
    
    % \sectionListItem
    %     Promoted the concept of API-first design principles within the firm for good software development practices.

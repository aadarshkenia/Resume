    \sectionListItem
        Led the initiative to improve document collaboration experience for clients by implementing RESTful web-services through a novel concept of API-first design (Swagger).
        
    \sectionListItem
        Optimized performance of poorly performing API operations leading to 3X better response times by proposing and implementing a new design using WebSphere message queues and JMS.    
        
    \sectionListItem
        Implemented an improved metadata routing component for a new system based on an event-driven, service oriented architecture and data serialization using Google Protocol Buffers. This contributed to decommissioning legacy, thereby cutting costs by \$1.7M annually.
    
    
    \sectionListItem
        Built a configurable middleware for routing requests to workflow systems, oversaw its evolution from proof of concept to being a core component of many production systems. Supported and maintained code base through continuous refactoring and improved code coverage from 50\% to 70\%.
        
    \sectionListItem
        Saved the firm hundreds of man hours spent in supporting production systems by automating the recovery of workflow systems from failed requests through periodic retries.
    
        
    % \sectionListItem
    %     Refactored thousands of lines of code in the gateway component to reduce redundancy, improved its unit test coverage from 50\% to 70\%. 
    
    % \sectionListItem    
    %     Effectively collaborated with teams based in Mumbai, Montreal and New York to work on multiple proof of concepts, some of which were deployed to production.
